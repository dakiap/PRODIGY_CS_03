# üåü Prodigy Infotech Summer Internship 2024 - Project Showcase üåü

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Prodigy Infotech Summer Internship 2024! This project showcases the work done during the internship, including practical insights and hands-on experience with cybersecurity projects.

## üöÄ Introduction

**Internship Period:** 1st June 2024 - 30th June 2024  

The internship period was of 4 weeks, focusing on developing tools for encryption and password strength assessment using Python.

## Projects

### Task 1: Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

This project involves creating a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Users can input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

#### Features
- **Encryption**: Encrypts the input message using the Caesar Cipher algorithm with a user-defined shift value.
- **Decryption**: Decrypts the encrypted message using the same shift value.
- **User Input**: Allows users to input the message and shift value.

### Task 2: Password Strength Assessment Tool

This project involves building a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on various criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It provides feedback to users on the password's strength.

#### Features
- **Length Check**: Ensures the password meets a minimum length requirement.
- **Character Check**: Checks for the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Strength Feedback**: Provides feedback on the password's strength (e.g., weak, moderate, strong).

## üìù Day-by-Day Progress
